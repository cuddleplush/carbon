# Carbon shell
A desktop shell using the [Astal](https://github.com/Aylur/astal) library.
> [!WARNING]
> If for whatever reason you wish to use this, please read the requirements carefully.<br>
> This shell only works on Hyprland, and currently requires either the [Hyprsplit](https://github.com/shezdy/hyprsplit) or [split-monitor-workspaces](https://github.com/Duckonaut/split-monitor-workspaces) plugins.<br>
> It will probably also work fine without these plugins if you only have 1 output.
